Possible solution: Install the build dependencies for the modules:
kjs
You can use 'sudo apt build-dep <source_package>', 'sudo dnf builddep <package>', 'sudo zypper source-install --build-deps-only <source_package>' or a similar command for your distro of choice.
See https://community.kde.org/Guidelines_and_HOWTOs/Build_from_source/Install_the_dependencies
