CMake Error at src/kjs/CMakeLists.txt:38 (message):
  The PCRE regular expression library has not been found.  KJS requires PCRE
  >= 4.5 to function properly.  If you for some reason can not install it,
  you can force a build with POSIX regex.h by passing
  -DKJS_FORCE_DISABLE_PCRE=true to cmake.  However, be advised that it'll
  result in many websites breaking
