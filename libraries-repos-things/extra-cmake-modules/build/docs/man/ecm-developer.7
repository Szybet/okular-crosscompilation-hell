.SH WRITING MODULES
.sp
The CMake 3 documentation (and \fI\%cmake\-developer(7)\fP in particular) has a lot of
useful information about writing CMake modules, including a large section
devoted to find modules. This guide will only highlight things that are
particular to the Extra CMake Modules project.
.sp
Most of these are stylistic points. For example, the license header for a module
in ECM should look like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# SPDX\-FileCopyrightText: 20XX Your Name <your.email@example.com>
#
# SPDX\-License\-Identifier: BSD\-3\-Clause
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Documentation is written in reStructuredText format and put inside a bracket
comment with a \fB\&.rst:\fP id after the opening bracket:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#[=======================================================================[.rst:

#]=======================================================================]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
(docs/sphinx/ext/ecm.py has code to extract the rst text from a comment with
such wrapping)
.sp
Functions should be used instead of macros unless there is a good reason not to
(and that reason should be noted in a comment), and lowercase should be used for
macros, functions and commands.
.sp
4 spaces is the generally\-recommended indent, although there are several files
that use 2 spaces; consistency within a file is more important than consistency
across files.
.sp
If in doubt, look at how other modules in Extra CMake Modules are written, and
follow the same pattern.
.SS Find Modules
.sp
A good template for find module documentation is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#[=======================================================================[.rst:
FindFoo
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

Finds the Foo library.

This will define the following variables:

\(ga\(gaFoo_FOUND\(ga\(ga
    True if (the requested version of) Foo is available
\(ga\(gaFoo_VERSION\(ga\(ga
    The version of Foo, if it is found
\(ga\(gaFoo_LIBRARIES\(ga\(ga
    This can be passed to target_link_libraries() instead of the \(ga\(gaFoo::Foo\(ga\(ga
    target
\(ga\(gaFoo_INCLUDE_DIRS\(ga\(ga
    This should be passed to target_include_directories() if the target is not
    used for linking
\(ga\(gaFoo_DEFINITIONS\(ga\(ga
    This should be passed to target_compile_options() if the target is not
    used for linking

If \(ga\(gaFoo_FOUND\(ga\(ga is TRUE, it will also define the following imported target:

\(ga\(gaFoo::Foo\(ga\(ga
    The Foo library

In general we recommend using the imported target, as it is easier to use.
Bear in mind, however, that if the target is in the link interface of an
exported library, it must be made available by the package config file.

Note the use of definition lists for the variables.

Because of the \fI\%ECMUseFindModules\fP module, projects may easily make
local copies of find modules, and may install those copies with their own CMake
project config files. For this reason, find modules should include the full BSD
3\-clause license:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

Find modules should always provide imported targets in addition to the
traditional variables (like \fBFoo_LIBRARIES\fP, etc).
.sp
Unlike find modules shipped with CMake, if the module requires a specific CMake
version it is not enough to warn when the minimum required version is not high
enough: you should also produce an error when the actual CMake version being
used is not high enough. This can be done with:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
if(CMAKE_VERSION VERSION_LESS 3.16.0)
    message(FATAL_ERROR \(dqCMake 3.16.0 is required by FindFoo.cmake\(dq)
endif()
if(CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION VERSION_LESS 3.16.0)
    message(AUTHOR_WARNING \(dqYour project should require at least CMake 3.16.0 to use FindFoo.cmake\(dq)
endif()

The \fI\%ECMFindModuleHelpers\fP module has several useful functions and
macros. For example, it allows you to replace the above version check with:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ecm_find_package_version_check(Foo)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Components
.sp
Using \fI\%ECMFindModuleHelpers\fP, creating a find module for a library with
several inter\-dependent components is reasonably straightforward. After the
documentation, you need to include the module and do the usual version check:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include(ECMFindModuleHelpers)
ecm_find_package_version_check(Foo)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The important macros are \fBecm_find_package_parse_components\fP and
\fBecm_find_package_handle_library_components\fP\&.  These take a list of
components, and query other variables you provide to find out the information
they require.  The documentation for \fI\%ECMFindModuleHelpers\fP provides
more information, but a simple setup might look like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set(Foo_known_components Bar Baz)
set(Foo_Bar_pkg_config \(dqfoo\-bar\(dq)
set(Foo_Bar_lib \(dqbar\(dq)
set(Foo_Bar_header \(dqfoo/bar.h\(dq)
set(Foo_Bar_pkg_config \(dqfoo\-baz\(dq)
set(Foo_Baz_lib \(dqbaz\(dq)
set(Foo_Baz_header \(dqfoo/baz.h\(dq)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If \fBBaz\fP depends on \fBBar\fP, for example, you can specify this with
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set(Foo_Baz_component_deps \(dqBar\(dq)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then call the macros:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ecm_find_package_parse_components(Foo
    RESULT_VAR Foo_components
    KNOWN_COMPONENTS ${Foo_known_components}
)
ecm_find_package_handle_library_components(Foo
    COMPONENTS ${Foo_components}
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Of course, if your components need unusual handling, you may want to replace
\fBecm_find_package_handle_library_components\fP with, for example, a \fBforeach\fP
loop over the components (the body of which should implement most of what a
normal find module does, including setting \fBFoo_<component>_FOUND\fP).
.sp
At this point, you should set \fBFoo_VERSION\fP using whatever information you
have available (such as from parsing header files).  Note that
\fBecm_find_package_handle_library_components\fP will set it to the version
reported by pkg\-config of the first component found, but this depends on the
presence of pkg\-config files, and the version of a component may not be the same
as the version of the whole package.  After that, finish off with
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include(FindPackageHandleStandardArgs)
find_package_handle_standard_args(Foo
    FOUND_VAR
        Foo_FOUND
    REQUIRED_VARS
        Foo_LIBRARIES
    VERSION_VAR
        Foo_VERSION
    HANDLE_COMPONENTS
)

.SH SUBMITTING MODULES
.sp
Proposed new modules should be submitted using the \fI\%KDE Review Board instance\fP,
and be assigned to the \fBbuildsystem\fP and \fBextracmakemodules\fP groups.  You
should be able to point to two separate projects that will make use of the
module.
